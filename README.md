# Front End Mentor Challenges

This repository contains my solutions to various Frontend Mentor challenges. Frontend Mentor is a platform that provides web development challenges aimed at improving front-end coding skills through real-life projects. Each challenge comes with a design file, a set of user stories, and sometimes a starter codebase.

In this repository, you'll find a folder for each challenge I've completed, along with the design file and my solution code. Each solution is responsive, accessible, and follows best practices for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Feel free to browse through the challenges and check out my solutions. If you're also working on Frontend Mentor challenges, feel free to fork this repository and submit a pull request with your solution.
